Experiments around a DMM prototyped in Section 3 of "Programming Patterns in Dataflow Matrix Machines and Generalized Recurrent Neural Nets", https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.09470

(A version of duplicate characters or duplicate words detector. We think this is a nice toy problem to work as a playground for initial "program synthesis via DMMs" experiments.)
