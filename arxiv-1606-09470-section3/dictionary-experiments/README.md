Since the ability to transform dictionary in the differentiable fashion is central to my approach,
and since it is going less smoothly than I was hoping for, let's dedicate a separate subdirectory
to experiments which involve taking gradients through dictionaries.

Note that examples in https://fluxml.ai/Zygote.jl/latest/ strongly suggest that it all should be easy.
